# CLAUDE.md — Moortown Baptist Church website rebuild

Read this first, every session.

## What this is

A rebuild of the Moortown Baptist Church (MBC) website in WordPress on a
GeneratePress child theme. The church is running a branding exercise
(expected to take a couple of months), so **look and feel will change late**.
Build structure and templates now; keep all styling swappable.

- Live site: https://moortownbaptistchurch.org.uk (DO NOT TOUCH)
- Sandbox:   https://new.moortownbaptistchurch.org.uk (all work happens here)
- Tagline:   "Loving God, living generously, following Christ."

## Source of truth for structure

The page menu and wireframes come from Andy Berry (deacon). Build to his
design, not the old three-column homepage layout, which is abandoned.

### Menu (parents are NOT links — toggles only, for touch devices)

- Logo (left) = Home link
- **About Us** → Who we are · What we believe · Meet the team · FAQs
- **What's On** → Sunday Mornings · Events · Beacon Cafe · Rock Solid ·
  Stepping Stones · Lunch Club · Craft Group · House Groups
- **Mission** → Mission Group · BMS · Leeds Furniture Mission ·
  Mission Aviation Fellowship · Romania · Moortown Emergency Relief Fund ·
  Pathways
- **Resources** → BU & YBA · Services on YouTube (external link) ·
  Room Hire · Policies & Documents · Giving
- **News** (single link)
- **Contact Us** (single link)

Same header and footer on every page.

### Wireframe layout (homepage)

- Header: logo left, nav right. Burger menu at tablet and below; menu opens
  as a full-width accordion list with chevrons on parent items.
- Hero: church name, tagline, three buttons, a line of small text.
- Four alternating image/text bands (zigzag): About Us, Sunday Mornings,
  More at Moortown, Get in touch (with social icons). Each band has a button.
  Two columns on desktop and tablet; image stacked above text on mobile.
- Footer: logo + name, "Stay Connected" newsletter signup, small links,
  copyright.
- Andy deliberately left out colours and fonts. Do not invent a brand.

## Architecture rules

1. **No Elementor for new pages.** Elementor and Elementor Pro remain active
   for legacy content only. New pages use core Gutenberg blocks (and
   GeneratePress features). Block markup must stay human-readable and
   diffable.
2. **All design values live in `generatepress-child/css/tokens.css`** as CSS
   custom properties on `:root` (colours, fonts, type scale, spacing,
   radii, breakpoints-as-comments). Components reference variables only —
   no hard-coded colours, font names or spacing anywhere else. Rebranding
   must be a tokens-only change.
3. Prefer PHP templates and template parts in the child theme over
   database-stored layouts, so everything is in git.
4. Zigzag bands = core Media & Text block (or a pattern built on it).
5. Four page templates cover the site:
   - **Info page** (About Us, Resources): prose, optional image, optional CTA.
   - **Activity page** (What's On ×8): when, where, who it's for, contact,
     image, description. Identical structure — use a block pattern or
     structured fields.
   - **Mission partner page** (×7): logo, summary, external link,
     how to support.
   - **Listing pages**: News (Query Loop), Events (fed by the "MBC Events"
     Google calendar), Contact.
6. Forms: Elementor Pro forms are not used for new pages. Contact form
   plugin is TBD — ask before installing anything. Newsletter signup uses
   MC4WP (Mailchimp for WordPress), already active.

## Repo layout

```
mbc-generatepress-child/        <- repo root (this file lives here)
└── generatepress-child/        <- the actual theme folder
```

The theme folder is `generatepress-child`, not `mbc-generatepress-child`.

## Deployment

`git push` to `main` → GitHub webhook → Plesk pulls and auto-deploys to
`wp-content/themes/generatepress-child/` on the sandbox within seconds.

- Commit small, with meaningful messages (not "Aligning Headers" ×4).
- Never commit credentials, `.env` files or anything from `~/.config/`.
- There is no staging between push and sandbox; the sandbox IS staging.

## Content and site config: REST API

No SSH to the server yet (Rockhost firewall), and the Plesk SSH shell is
chrooted. Pages, menus and settings are managed via the WordPress REST API.

- Credentials: `~/.config/mbc/wp.env` (WP_URL, WP_USER=claude-code,
  WP_APP_PASSWORD). Never print, echo or log the password.
- Load in a subshell:
  ```bash
  ( set -a; . ~/.config/mbc/wp.env; set +a; /usr/bin/curl -s -u "$WP_USER:$WP_APP_PASSWORD" "$WP_URL/wp-json/wp/v2/pages?per_page=100&_fields=id,slug,title,parent" )
  ```
- User `claude-code` is an Administrator (needed for menus).
- Useful endpoints: `/wp/v2/pages`, `/wp/v2/media`, `/wp/v2/menus`,
  `/wp/v2/menu-items`, `/wp/v2/templates`.
- Note: WP 7.1 returns `rest_not_logged_in` for a wrong password, not
  `incorrect_password`. Check the username/password pairing first.
- Scripts that create pages or menus must be idempotent (look up by slug,
  update if present, create if not).

## Environment

- WSL2 Ubuntu on Windows 10 (PLUTO). Windows PATH is NOT imported.
- Work inside `~/src/`, never under `/mnt/c` or `/mnt/d`.
- Server: Rockhost shared Plesk, PHP 8.2, Apache + PHP-FPM, WP 7.1.

## Coding conventions

- British English in all user-facing text and comments.
- SI units.
- Bash: explicit paths (`/usr/bin/curl`, `/bin/ls`); do not assume PATH.
- Python: f-strings, `pathlib`, explicit error handling. pip outside a venv:
  always `--break-system-packages`.
- When showing John code to paste, give complete files, not diffs.
- Be concise.

## Safety

- Sandbox only. Never call the live site's API or touch its files.
- Ask before: installing or removing plugins, changing permalinks,
  deleting pages or media, editing `.htaccess` or `wp-config.php`.
- `.htaccess` on the sandbox has a deliberate `SetEnvIf Authorization`
  line above `# BEGIN WordPress`. Leave it.

## Status (Oct 2026)

- [x] Toolchain: WSL, Claude Code, GitHub SSH, push-to-deploy, REST auth
- [ ] Wireframe detail screenshots from Andy's Canva (in `docs/wireframes/`)

      `page-templates/e2e-test.php`, test page ID 620 (`mbc-e2e-test`) —
      remove before launch (ask first)
- [ ] `tokens.css` real tokens + base styles (currently only a placeholder)
- [ ] Install `php-cli` in WSL for linting (needs John to run sudo in a terminal)
- [ ] Header, footer, accordion/dropdown menu with non-linking parents
- [ ] Four page templates
- [ ] Idempotent scaffold script: pages, hierarchy, menu
- [ ] Content migration from live site (via its public REST API, read-only)
